// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Input a number and save to a variable
Input a second number and save to a variable
Add the 2 numbers and save the result

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input the number and save to a variable
IF number % 2 then the number is Even
ELSE the number is odd
print out the result

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.

Create an array of numbers - numArray
While totalNumbers is < 5, input number from the user
Push each new number to numArray


b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

Loop through the numArray and add numbers to accumlator variable
Divide the sum of the number by 5 and save to a numAverage variable



c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

Sort the array of numbers in ascending order
Assign the first location of numArray to lowestNum
Assign the last location of numArray to highestNum


d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

print("The average of your 5 numbers is", numAverage)
print("The lowest of your 5 numbers is", lowestNum)
print("The highest of your 5 numbers is", highestNumNum)
